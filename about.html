<h1>About</h1>

<p>The i3 project aims to deliver a robust, well-documented tiling window manager  that is 100% configurable and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.</p>

<p>Compared to other tiling window managers, it:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Uses <a href="https://xcb.freedesktop.org/">xcb</a> over xlib for improved speed</li>
    <li>Implements multi-monitor correctly, that is by assigning each workspace to a virtual screen</li>
    <li>Provides an IPC interface for other programs to use</li>
    <li>Uses a tree as data structure. This allows for more flexible layouts than the column-based approach</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that we really strive to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
        Write well readable, well <strong>documented</strong> code. Create additional
        documentation on how to extend i3 by explaining its internal workings.
        <br />
        This includes being modifiable by people who do know how to program but who are
        not necessarily familiar with all of X11’s internals. That is, document why
        things happen and when they happen so that the user gets a picture of the whole
        process a Window Manager is responsible of by just reading the source code.
    </li>
    <li>
        Never break configuration files or existing workflows. Breaking changes
        require a major version bump (v4 → v5).
    </li>
    <li>
        Keep mental complexity low: once you know i3’s key features, other features
        should be easy to understand.
    </li>
    <li>
        Only add features which benefit many people, instead of going to great
        lengths to support rarely used workflows.
    </li>
    <li>
        Only documented behavior is supported. Clear documentation is a requirement
        for contributions.
    </li>
</ul>
