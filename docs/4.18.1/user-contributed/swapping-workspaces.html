<h1>User-contributed article: Swapping workspaces</h1>

<p>
If you have workspace 1 on one monitor and workspace 2 on another monitor and
want to quickly swap the workspaces among the monitors, you can use i3's IPC
mechanisms to do it.
</p>

<p>
i3 already includes a way to move an individual workspace from one monitor to
another. But what we want to achieve is the <strong>simultaneous</strong>
movement of workspaces between the monitors. To do this, we can write a script
that detects the currently active workspace on each monitor and then moves that
workspace to the other monitor.
</p>

<pre><tt>#!/usr/bin/env bash
# requires jq

IFS=:
i3-msg -t get_outputs | jq -r '.[]|"\(.name):\(.current_workspace)"' | grep -v '^null:null$' | \
while read -r name current_workspace; do
    echo "moving ${current_workspace} right..."
    i3-msg workspace "${current_workspace}"
    i3-msg move workspace to output right   
done</tt></pre>

<p>
To use this script, I recommend binding it to a keyboard shortcut in your i3 config:
</p>
<pre><tt>bindsym $mod+Shift+s exec /path/to/your/script/i3-display-swap.sh</tt></pre>
<p>
Now restart i3 in place. The next time you press mod+Shift+s, your workspaces will be swapped among your monitors.
</p>
